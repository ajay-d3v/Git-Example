## Lessons Learned  
- Always create a separate branch for every new task (bug fix, feature, enhancement, etc.).  
- Make changes only in that branch to avoid disturbing other branches.  
- Once the task is completed, merge the branch into the `develop` branch.  
- The `develop` branch will then be reviewed, tested, and finally merged into the `master` branch.  

## Challenge Faced  
- Encountered difficulties managing multiple GitHub accounts locally.
